# release

Bash [script](/release) for automating releases. Uses [git-cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff) to get a version suggestion, updates the changelog, and creates a new version tag.

## ‚ú® Features

- Ensures releases are made from the default branch
- Verifies the working directory is clean
- Checks if the local repository is up-to-date
- Suggests a version number using git-cliff
- Updates the CHANGELOG.md file
- Creates a signed and annotated git tag
- Supports custom pre-release and post-release hooks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script performs a signed tag operation (`git tag -s`). Ensure you have a [GPG key set up](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key) for signing.

## üìù Usage

1. [Set up git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/docs/).
2. Place the `release` script in your project's root directory.
3. Run the script:

```bash
bash release [version_tag]
```

If you don't provide a version tag, the script will suggest one based on git-cliff's output.

This script works best when you ensure your commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format. Check out my tool [git-sumi](https://github.com/welpo/git-sumi) to enforce this format on your projects.

## ü™ù Hooks

The script supports custom hooks for project-specific release tasks. Create executable files in a `.release-hooks` directory in your project root:

- `pre-release`: First thing that runs after verifying script is ready to go
- `post-release`: Runs after creating the release tag

Hooks receive the version tag (e.g., "v1.2.3") as their first argument. Example of a bash pre-release hook:

```bash
# .release-hooks/pre-release
#!/usr/bin/env bash

VERSION_TAG="$1"
poetry version "${VERSION_TAG#v}"  # Update version in pyproject.toml
```

Hooks can be in any language as long as they are executable (`chmod +x` required).
